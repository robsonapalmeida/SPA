The goal of this app is to schedule some SPA appointments


  -This is a project made with my son. Why do I start writhing it?. Due to the fact that this simple project, made my son got a job offer    in Mexico and his dream come true.

   I know there is a lot of other tools to develop here, but, It's been working

   The important part of it is that it saves a business

   It is a simple agenda that doesn't need even to login in, I insisted to the owner of the business to create a WebApp with at least        login, but he did not want because its customers complained a lot about one more app to log in, even using facebook or google account.
   I tried to convince the customer to use something more beautiful, but, he needed something really simple.
